    %div(class="how-we-use") 
      %h2 How We Use Your Information
      %p
        We use the information we collect to provide, maintain, protect, and improve our services, to develop new
        ones, and to protect ourselves and our users. We may combine information from one of our services with
        information from other services, or with information from our partners.
      %p
        We also use the information we collect to let you know about new or updated services. srnd.org is a
        non-profit which is funded by contributions from the public, so we may also use this information to contact
        you, your friends, or your family members about donation and volunteer opportunities.
      %p
        We may collect and store this information in a country outside the one where you live.
      %p
        We will ask your permission before using this information for a purpose other than what we've described
        here.
    
    %div(class="what-we-share") 
      %h2 What Information We Share
      %p
        We provide some information to trusted partners to process it for us in compliance with appropriate security
        and confidentiality measures. For example, we provide your payment information to Stripe, which processes
        credit card transactions for us.
      %p
        We may share aggregated, non-personally-identifying information with our partners or publicly, such as to
        show trends.
      %p
        Limited information, such as your name, email, and the information we get when you use our services, may
        be shared with partners who are interested in recruiting you for a job, internship, or college, or with
        partners who provide services of interest to developers. We believe these sort of partnerships provide
        us both with benefits, but you can opt out of this sort of sharing by sending us an email.
      %p
        We will provide information agencies, organizations if we have a good-faith belief that doing so is necessary
        to:
      %ul 
        %li Meet an applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request
        %li Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.
        %li Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of us, our users, our partners, or the public.
      
    
    %div(class="information-security") 
      %h2 Information Security
      %p
        We use industry-standard measures to protect our data from unauthorized alteration or disclosure.
        In particular:
      %ul 
        %li
          We encrypt many of our services using HTTPS/TLS
        %li
          We review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security
          measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems.
        %li
          We restrict access to personal information to employees, contractors, and agents who need to know that
          information in order to provide, maintain, protect, or improve our services.
