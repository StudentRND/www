        <p>We believe in providing the best experience to the community possible in everything we do. As a result, we
           stand behind our products and services 100%. We've created this return policy to enable as many returns as
           possible while preventing abuse.</p>
        <p>To request a return under this policy, contact
           <a href="mailto:support@studentrnd.org">support@studentrnd.org</a>.</p>

        <h2>Tickets and Registration Fees</h2>
        <h3>Full Refunds</h3>
        <p>If you purchased tickets to an event and are no longer able to attend, you are entitled to a refund any time
            prior to 7 days before the start of the event.</p>
        <p>Please note that, because ticket costs cover food and other event supplies, <strong>we cannot process refunds
           within 7 days of the event</strong>.</p>
        <p>If your refund is accepted, your ticket will be cancelled, and you will no longer be able to attend the
           event.</p>

        <h3>Partial Refunds</h3>
        <p>If you purchase a ticket and later find a discount code which would have resulted in a lower price, we will
           refund the difference if requested <strong>no later than one week after the end of the event.</strong></p>

    <section class="donations">
        <h2>Donations</h2>
        <p>As a general principle, donations are presumed by law to be irrevocable gifts unless otherwise specified in
           an agreement or contract. This is an important legal concept that, among other things, permits gifts to be
           tax-deductible.</p>
        <p>That said, if a donation was made in error (such as a typo, double-charge, or a forgotten subscription) we
            can refund the incorrect charge <strong>within 60 days of the donation</strong>.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="physical">
        <h2>Physical Products</h2>
        <p>Products purchased in-person or from our online-store are eligible for return up to <strong>60 days after
           it is shipped.</strong> Products need not be like-new, but must not have damage caused by improper use or
           accidents.</p>
        <p>When you request a return, we will require that you ship your product back to us. You will be responsible for
           paying return shipping costs, except in the case of a defect, in which case we will send you a shipping
           label.</p>
        <p>If you are shipping an item over $75, you should consider using a trackable shipping service or purchasing
           shipping insurance. We donâ€™t guarantee that we will receive your returned item.</p>
        <p>Once your return is received and inspected we will send you an email to notify you that we have received your
           returned item. We will also notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund. If you are approved,
           then your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your credit card or
           original method of payment. This credit may take up to 30 days to appear on your statement.</p>
        <p>Except in the case of a defect, original shipping costs are non-refundable. If you receive a refund, the
           original cost of shipping will not be included in the refund amount.</p>
